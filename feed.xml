My favorite part was a brief disassembly exercise to determine the functionality of a mystery binary. Get your toolkit ready and follow along for a solution to Blog.

Anthem is a great box for beginners because the only tool you need is nmap. All of the flags are discoverable using recon. Here we go!

You know, that pseudonym everyone in the community will come to know you as. Some, whether by choice or ignorance, choose their given name (johnsmith). Others choose their favorite sports team (eaglesfan78), animal (reddragon), or character from their preferred media platform (pickleric...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Reversing a WordPress Backdoor</title><link href="https://www.redteamreadme.com/posts/wordpress-backdoor/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reversing a WordPress Backdoor" /><published>2022-02-01T17:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2025-04-11T23:14:27-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.redteamreadme.com/posts/wordpress-backdoor/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://www.redteamreadme.com/posts/wordpress-backdoor/" /> <author> <name>dnstun0</name> </author> <summary>On January 18th, 2022, Jetpack published their discovery of a supply chain attack affecting 93 WordPress themes and plugins.

There are two brute force tasks that must be completed to obtain credentials, and the TryHackMe throttling I experienced makes this unbearably slow. If you’re going to attempt this box, I’d recommend watching the walkthrough and grabbing the credentials from there or just skipping this box ent...</summary> </entry> </feed>
